      <h2>December 17th, 2025</h2>
      <p>Currently working on this website. I've been exposed to CSS and HTML through my job but never created anything myself. It hasn't been too hard and it actually makes sense. The only "issue" I've had so far is wrapping my head around how things visually correlate on the page. I'm just using recommended dimensions and styles but I know I'll eventually want to change things.</p>
